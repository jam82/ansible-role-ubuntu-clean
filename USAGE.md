# ansible-role-skeleton

Skeleton for use with ansible-galaxy to create a new ansible role.

## Requirements

Ansible 2.5 or higher is required.

For running the default tests with molecule docker you need the following packages installed:

* docker
* molecule
* molecule[docker]

To use the predefined tests with kvm/libvirt you need to have the following packages installed:

* qemu
* virt-manager
* molecule
* molecule[vagrant]
* molecule[vagrant]
* molecule[libvirt]
* [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
* vagrant-libvirt

Your user needs to be in the `libvirt` system group, because the qemu system domain is used.

To install os specific requirements please search the internet.

For molecule do the following:

```shell
pip install --user 'molecule'
pip install --user 'molecule[vagrant]'
pip install --user 'molecule[libvirt]'
```

For the vagrant-libvirt plugin you need the libvirt-dev package of your os installed.

Then you can install the plugin by issuing:

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
```

## Usage

```shell
